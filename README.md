# Szon_SC_SP_Frontend_Proj


## DESCRIPTION

This repository was created as a part of the FIS: Software Developement curriculum. The goal is to create a single page Web App which interacts with a custom Rails API. You can find the Scamazon API here: https://github.com/horaciovelvetine/scamazon_backend . The concept is to build a Shopping cart which mimics the functionality of Amazon.com. Per the project requirements this is was writting in vanilla JS. 

## Getting Started
This page will not work without a copy of the backend running locally, but is otherwise simple to get up and running. Simply open up the index.html page in this directory in any browser. NOTE: It is very limited, and only replicates a shopping cart, any and all of the other links on the page will not work.
